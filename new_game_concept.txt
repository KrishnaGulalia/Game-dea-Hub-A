I have a idea for a RPG/Puzzle action game revolved around 
indian fables
It is revolved around Panchatantra 
like there would be levels where we start as animals and with timne grow and change in to different beings and the story evolves, we use our wit and decisions to move ahead
there could me many stories and story lines involved in this
the environment can be inspired by indian forests, greenry , indian civilisation 
we can make a good graphic game revolved around this with a solid story line that will keep the users hooked 
there is also an anime around this concept well not exactly but people can get an indea so i am mentioning its name below
The Anime is called - To Your Eternity (Fumetsu no Anata e)
its sypnosis- It, a mysterious immortal being, is sent to the Earth with no emotions nor identity. However, It is able to take the shape of those around that have a strong impetus. At first, It is a sphere. Then, It imitates the form of a rock. As the temperature drops and snow falls atop the moss, It inherits the moss. When an injured, lone wolf comes limping by and lays down to die, It takes on the form of the animal. Finally, It gains consciousness and begins to traverse the empty tundra until It meets a boy. The boy lives alone in a ghost town, which the adults abandoned long ago in search of the paradise said to exist far beyond the endless sea of white tundra. However, their efforts were for naught, and now the boy is in a critical state. Acquiring the form of the boy, It sets off on a never-ending journey, in search of new experiences, places, and people.
